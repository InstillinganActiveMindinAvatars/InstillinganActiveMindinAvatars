# Anonymous Artifact for Peer Review

This repository is a read-only artifact for the anonymous peer review of a scientific paper. To preserve the integrity of the double-blind review process, the authors will not monitor or respond to any form of communication (e.g., issues, pull requests, comments) during the review period.

**Author-provided content:** To provide a demonstration video, the authors are responsible for the following files and directory: `index.html`, `roboto.woff2`, and the `vis/` directory. Any other content present in this repository is automatically generated by the hosting platform and is not related to the authors or the submission.
